# covidInd-twitterbot
A twitter bot I made which replies the districts real-time corona virus cases in **India**.

Inorder to use it you should have a twitter developer account and once you have it use the keys in their respective variables.
The bot will reply to the tweets which have mentioned it along with a syntax of the district's data it is requesting for.

#### Syntax for mentioning the bot:
@twitter-bot-account #state_name.district_name (or) @twitter-bot-account #state_code.district_name

#### Example:
@twitter-bot-account #tamil_nadu.tiruppur (or) @twitter-bot-account #tn.tiruppur

#### The data is obtained from [covid19india.org](covid19india.org)

Thanks <3
